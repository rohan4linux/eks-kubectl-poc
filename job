“Hi, my name is Rohan Reddy. I have around 7 and a half years of experience in IT, with the last 6+ years focused on DevOps and cloud technologies.

Currently, I am working as a DevOps Engineer at VOIS (Vodafone Intelligent Solutions), since January 2024.

In my current role, I work mainly on AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, VPC, Route 53, CloudWatch, EBS, and EFS to set up and manage cloud infrastructure.

I manage containerized applications using Kubernetes on EKS and deploy workloads using Helm charts and ArgoCD.

I’ve worked with CloudWatch, CloudTrail, Config, and GuardDuty for logging, monitoring, and improving security visibility.

I build and maintain CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, and I use Terraform and CloudFormation to automate AWS resource provisioning.

For secure environments, I have used WAF, Shield, and ACM certificates to protect web applications and encrypt communication.

I’ve also worked with services like SNS, SQS, and EventBridge for notifications and event-driven automation.

In storage, I’ve used EBS, EFS, and AWS Backup for persistent data needs and backups.

I also set up Auto Scaling Groups, manage Lambda functions, and have knowledge of Elastic Beanstalk for application deployments.

I collaborate closely with developers and testers, help in resolving CI/CD issues, and take part in monitoring dashboards using Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch metrics.

Overall, my goal is to ensure secure, scalable, and highly available cloud environments.”
