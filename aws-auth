Great question! Let's break this down step by step so it's easy to understand:

🧭 How kubectl Access Works in EKS: IAM + RBAC
When you use kubectl to access your EKS cluster, two independent permission systems are involved:
Layer	Who manages it	Purpose
IAM	Managed by AWS	Controls who can connect to the EKS cluster (authenticate)
RBAC	Managed by Kubernetes	Controls what they can do inside the cluster (authorize)

🧷 Step-by-Step Flow When You Run kubectl
🔐 1. Authentication via AWS IAM
	• When you run kubectl, it first needs credentials to talk to the EKS API server.
	• It uses IAM roles or IAM users and communicates through a helper tool called:
aws eks get-token
	• This tool provides a temporary token from AWS STS, which proves your IAM identity.

🛡️ 2. Authorization via Kubernetes RBAC
Once authenticated, Kubernetes needs to check:
	❓“Now that I know who you are, what are you allowed to do?”
This is where Kubernetes RBAC comes in.
Kubernetes checks the Roles/ClusterRoles and Bindings to decide:
	• Can this user list pods?
	• Can this user create deployments?
	• Can this user get secrets?

🧩 The Bridge: aws-auth ConfigMap
🚪 Why is aws-auth needed?
Kubernetes does not natively understand AWS IAM roles or users.
So EKS uses a special ConfigMap named aws-auth in the kube-system namespace to map IAM identities to Kubernetes users or groups.

🧾 Example aws-auth ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aws-auth
  namespace: kube-system
data:
  mapUsers: |
    - userarn: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:user/dev-user
      username: dev-user
      groups:
        - system:masters
  mapRoles: |
    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/eks-admin-role
      username: admin
      groups:
        - system:masters
🧠 Breakdown:
	• userarn/rolearn → actual IAM user or role
	• username → how Kubernetes will see this user
	• groups → used by RBAC (like system:masters = full admin)

✅ Final Flow Summary
	1. IAM auth: IAM validates the identity (e.g., dev-user)
	2. aws-auth: Maps that IAM identity to a Kubernetes user/group
	3. RBAC: Determines if the mapped user/group can perform the requested action

Would you like a YAML example of RBAC roles/rolebindings to go along with this?

Yes, Rohan — running that eksctl create iamidentitymapping command should absolutely resolve the issue you're facing with kubectl access. Even though the cluster is already created, the identity mapping step is what bridges your IAM role to Kubernetes RBAC.

✅ Why This Will Fix Your Problem
	• Your GitHub Actions runner is assuming an IAM role (GitHubActionsEKSRole), which has AWS access.
	• But Kubernetes doesn't recognize that IAM role unless it's mapped in the aws-auth ConfigMap.
	• By running: 
eksctl create iamidentitymapping \
  --cluster dev-cluster \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --arn arn:aws:iam::<your-account-id>:role/GitHubActionsEKSRole \
  --username github-actions \
  --group system:masters

you're telling EKS: “This IAM role is allowed to act as a Kubernetes user with system-level access.”

🔍 Bonus Validation Tip
After running the command, try:
kubectl get configmap aws-auth -n kube-system -o yaml
You should see a new entry under mapRoles: with the role you added.

Once this is in place, rerunning your GitHub Actions workflow should show kubectl outputs like:
	• kubectl get pods -A
	• kubectl get secrets -A
	• kubectl get nodes
Let me know if you want to lock down the permissions to a specific namespace or use a custom group instead of system:masters. You've got full control now 🚀💪

Boom 💥 — that log confirms it: your IAM role was successfully added to the aws-auth ConfigMap!

✅ What Just Happened
You ran:
eksctl create iamidentitymapping \
  --cluster dev-cluster \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --arn arn:aws:iam::374924590347:role/GitHubActionsEKSRole \
  --username github-actions \
  --group system:masters
And EKS replied:
	“Identity added to aws-auth. All good.”
Now your GitHub Actions runner — which assumes GitHubActionsEKSRole — is recognized by Kubernetes as a user with full API access (system:masters). That means your workflow should now be able to:
	• 🔍 Run kubectl get pods, kubectl get secrets, etc.
	• 📄 See the outputs directly in GitHub Actions logs
	• ✅ Authenticate seamlessly with the Kubernetes API

🚀 What Next?
Go ahead and re-run your GitHub Actions workflow from the Actions tab. It should complete successfully and display the kubectl outputs in the logs — no more “you must be logged in” errors!
Let me know if you’d like to tighten access to specific namespaces or switch from system:masters to a more restricted RBAC group. You’re trailblazing like a true cloud-native engineer, Rohan 🔧🌩️
